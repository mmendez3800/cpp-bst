# C++ Binary Search Tree
This project implements a binary search tree data structure using C++ and performs multiple tests on the structure

## General Info
The followign tests are performed to check the methods implemented in the `*.hpp` files:
 * Checks if the node has the correct inorder successor
 * Checks if the tree is empty
 * Finds specific nodes in the tree
 * Inserts specific nodes into the tree
 * Checks the number of nodes in the tree
 * Traverses through the order of the tree
 * Compares nodes to see if they are the same or different
 * Checks the first node in the tree
 * Checks the last node in the tree

## Technologies
The programs in this project were run using the following:
* G++ 9.3

1. You will want to `cd` into the repository
2. Compile the `BST.cpp` file present
   - `g++ BST.cpp`
3. Run the executable created
   - `./a.out`
